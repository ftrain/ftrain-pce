Just an attempt to give away my personal composition environment for
working on long pieces, fiction, etc. Mostly a bunch of LaTeX stuff
with some dependencies and a few hacks to get it out of markdown into
formats appropriate for readings, publication, proofing, galleys,
etc., to help me as a writer visualize and deal with my own stuff.

TODO
-- Document the document system
-- Possibly (plausibly) migrate to Python; get away from Makefiles and maybe go for SCons?
-- Nap
